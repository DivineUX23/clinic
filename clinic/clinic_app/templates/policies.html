            Drugs, cosmetics, and perishable items are non-returnable or refundable after purchase. We advise all prospective customers to review all available product information before purchase, as the nature of our business restricts return options.

            Medical devices under warranty can be returned only after establishing a defect as a manufacturer error and not customer induced. This should be done within seven (7) days after purchase. Items returned beyond this cut-off period will not be accepted.
